# Valorant Champions 2022 data analysis

[Champions vlr page](https://www.vlr.gg/event/1015/valorant-champions-2022/)

I was bored on the weekend then remembered its the finals of Valorant champions 2022, so I put up a weekend project to analyse and try to come up with a couple of KPI's for analysing the teams specially the finalists.

I started by scrapping the data from vlr.gg as currently there is no proper api to give all the details about the tournament matches.

#### For scrapping the data we just need to change the vlr link to the target tournament and just running the notebook will create a csv of player stats and json files for each match.

I had many ideas so the analysis notebook doesn't contain the basic analysis of player and team stats, it contains some of the interesting ones.

We can see how the finals compare to what I found with this analysis.

## Thanks for looking into this. You can raise a pull request if interested in adding something!!
## Enjoy!!!
